To play Vertex, you must have Python 3 and Pygame installed.

You can download Python 3 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install Pygame, run command prompt as administrator and enter this line:

py -m pip install pygame --user


Once that's done, just download the game files as a .zip, extract them to a folder, and run the Vertex.py file
